# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Modeling Using Simscape – BLDC & DC Motor Architectures

This repository contains two electric vehicle models developed using **Simscape and MATLAB/Simulink**, each using a different motor type: **Brushless DC (BLDC)** and **DC motors**. These models are intended for educational and prototyping purposes in EV powertrain simulation.

> ⚠️ This repository does not include source files due to EVER 2024 competition confidentiality.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To compare and evaluate two different EV architectures:
- **Simscape EV model with BLDC motor**
- **Simscape EV model with DC motor**

Each model represents a full powertrain simulation including:
- Electric motor drive
- Vehicle dynamics (load, rolling resistance, air drag)
- Energy consumption
- Throttle profile and speed tracking

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **MATLAB/Simulink (R2023 or later)**
- **Simscape & Simscape Electrical**
- **BLDC Motor Library**
- **DC Motor Model Components**
- **Scopes for output visualization**
